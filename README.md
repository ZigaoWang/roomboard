ðŸ“Œ Project Proposal: RoomBoard

A Shared Digital Whiteboard for Roommates and Students

â¸»

ðŸ§  What Is It?

RoomBoard is a collaborative app designed for students who live together â€” especially in dorms or boarding schools. It gives roommates a shared digital whiteboard where they can add sticky notes, checklists, photos, and reminders, all in one place.

Itâ€™s like having a real whiteboard on the wall of your room, but smarter, cleaner, and always available on your iPad.

ðŸŽ¯ What Can You Do With It?
	â€¢	Write sticky notes with reminders or thoughts
	â€¢	Create shared to-do lists (like chores or prep for events)
	â€¢	Add photos (fun moments, important notices, etc.)
	â€¢	Move things around freely, just like a real board
	â€¢	Share the board with your roommates or group

ðŸ’¡ Why Itâ€™s Useful

In a shared space like a dorm, communication and coordination are important â€” but group chats often get messy, and normal to-do apps feel too personal. RoomBoard brings everything together visually, so it feels natural, like a shared space.

Itâ€™s helpful for:
	â€¢	Keeping track of chores or tasks
	â€¢	Reminding each other of important deadlines
	â€¢	Planning events, trips, or study sessions
	â€¢	Just having a fun place to post jokes, ideas, or photos

ðŸ‘¥ Who Will Use It?
	â€¢	Roommates in boarding schools or colleges
	â€¢	Friends sharing a dorm or apartment
	â€¢	Small groups or study teams
	â€¢	Club leaders who want a shared planning space

ðŸŽ¨ What Makes It Different?

Unlike traditional to-do apps or messaging groups, RoomBoard focuses on the shared experience. Itâ€™s not just a list â€” itâ€™s a living board that everyone in the room can see, touch, and add to. It combines structure (like tasks) with creativity (like sticky notes and photos), making daily life more connected and organized.
